## Introduction

In the age of AI and computer vision, tracking objects in real-time is a critical task. This demo software leverages the latest advancements in deep learning to provide efficient and accurate tracking solutions. By combining YOLOv8 for detection and ByteTrack for tracking, this tool can process video streams effectively, whether on a CPU or GPU.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection:** Utilize YOLOv8 for fast and accurate object detection.
- **Multi-Object Tracking:** Track multiple objects simultaneously using ByteTrack.
- **Flexible Hardware Support:** Run on both CPU and GPU, allowing for versatility in deployment.
- **Easy to Use:** Simple setup and straightforward usage make it accessible for everyone.
- **OpenCV Integration:** Use OpenCV for video handling and display.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps to install the necessary dependencies:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yghan31/multi-tracking-YOLOv8-ByteTrack.git
   cd multi-tracking-YOLOv8-ByteTrack
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages:**

   Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Setup Environment:**

   If you plan to run the software on a GPU, ensure you have the appropriate CUDA drivers installed. You can check your GPU compatibility on the [NVIDIA website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

## Usage

To use the software, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Video Stream:**

   You can use a local video file or a live camera feed. Ensure that your video source is accessible.

2. **Run the Application:**

   Execute the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python main.py --source <your_video_source>
   ```

   Replace `<your_video_source>` with the path to your video file or the camera index (e.g., `0` for the first camera).

3. **View Results:**

   The application will open a window displaying the video stream with detected and tracked objects. Press `q` to exit.

## Examples
